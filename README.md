Dinosaurus-dozen app reproduces the visualisations and summary statistics for 13 datasets which each conform to same summary statistics (mean, SD, correl) but still have very different distributions. 
This provides a nice example which may be helpful in educating data analysts to look beyond summary the stats and see the data's underlying distribution. 

The ShinyApp can be operated from here: https://atyepa.shinyapps.io/Datasaurus/
