Datasaurus-dozen app reproduces the visualisations and summary statistics for 13 datasets which each conform to same summary statistics (mean, SD, correl) but still have very different distributions. 
This provides a fun example to help make the point about that seeing distributions is just as important as the summary stats. 

The ShinyApp can be operated from here: https://atyepa.shinyapps.io/Datasaurus/
